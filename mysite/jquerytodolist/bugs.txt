WORKS:

- sequence works w/o refresh: add, complete, undo, complete, purge
- refuses to accept < in text input boxes

DELIBERATE BUGS:
- Search button does nothing 
- add task button adds tasks in a broken way 


NEEDS FIXING:
- currently empty pending list will not have "No such tasks exist" when empty.
- editing doesn't work

- multiple copies of the same task are merged on reload

- undo button doesn't work for tasks in search

- add pointer cursor to buttons

- prettify Search output

- adding task doesn't clear the search

- display - empty string or table

- one function that inserts a pending task + event listeners, another for inserting completed tasks and implements them (page load, clicking relevant buttons)

- amend search to only use two tables instead of 4
