WORKS:

- sequence works w/o refresh: add, complete, undo, complete, purge
- refuses to accept < in text input boxes

DELIBERATE BUGS:
- Search button does nothing 
- add task button adds tasks in a broken way 


NEEDS FIXING:
- currently empty pending list will not have "No such tasks exist" when empty.

- editing doesn't work

- multiple copies of the same task are merged on reload

- display - empty string or table




VIKTOR'S REQUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED
- undo button doesn't work for tasks in search
- prettify Search output
- adding task doesn't clear the search
- amend search to only use two tables instead of 4
- remove all IDs from HTML, use class instead
- add pointer cursor to buttons
- one function that inserts a pending task + event listeners, another for inserting completed tasks and implements them (page load, clicking relevant buttons)
- use jquery to find template (class), clone it 
- on click, find the parent / gparent with a CLASS and use *that* to fetch the task number
- have text field be own class and use that as hook to place actual text
- only one data-id - in the <tr>
